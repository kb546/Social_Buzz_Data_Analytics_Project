# Social Buzz Data Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the data analytics project completed as part of the **Accenture Virtual Internship**. The project focuses on analyzing big data for **Social Buzz**, a fast-growing social media and content creation company. The goal was to audit their data practices, provide insights into content categories, and offer recommendations to scale their operations for a successful IPO.

## Key Objectives
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressing missing values and removing irrelevant columns to prepare the data for analysis.
- **Data Merging**: Combining datasets using VLOOKUP to form a unified table for easier analysis.
- **Pivot Table Analysis**: Creating pivot tables to extract insights on content categories and user reactions.
- **Data Visualization**: Building engaging visualizations to highlight trends such as popular content categories and monthly post distribution.

## Process Breakdown

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values by either removing or imputing data, ensuring the dataset was accurate and relevant.
- Removed unnecessary columns to streamline the analysis process, focusing on critical data points such as content type, category, reactions, and timestamps.

### 2. Data Merging
- Used **VLOOKUP** to combine multiple tables, ensuring all relevant data was consolidated for a holistic analysis.
- Merged different data sources (content, reactions, and user data) into a unified dataset.

### 3. Pivot Table Analysis
- Created **pivot tables** to identify the top 5 content categories with the highest engagement.
- Analyzed user reactions, identifying trends in sentiment and engagement over time.

### 4. Data Visualization
- Developed visualizations in Excel and Power BI to present key findings:
  - The most popular content categories based on user reactions.
  - Reaction trends across different types of content (photos, videos, GIFs).
  - Monthly distribution of posts to identify peak activity periods.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, merging, pivot tables, and initial visualizations.
- **Power BI**: Advanced data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **SQL**: Extracted and manipulated datasets from a relational database.
- **VLOOKUP**: Used to merge multiple data tables into one.

## Key Results
